        I am a passionate and proactive Full-Stack Engineer. I have a
        mathematical and organized brain, which makes me a great coder. I love
        not just writing code, but building beautiful reliable products. At the
        same time, I am highly visual, which is crucial for the user interface
        of applications. I like chess, art and literature. Before my journey
        into Tech, I was an experienced photo editor working for women's
        magazines. I was inspired to move into technology seeing how automation
        revolutionized teamwork and efficiency within publishing houses. I take
        pride in delivering high-quality work and helping teams produce elegant
        and functional products. Delighted to transfer the teamwork abilities
        cultivated in magazine work to the field of software development. Now I
        am taking part in a charity project and I am learning Next.JS.
